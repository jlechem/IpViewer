Welcome to the read me file for the IP Viewer project.  IP Viewer is an MFC based application for Microsoft Windows.  Because of this it requires the following products to compile.

Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, SP 1, with the ATL security update.  This is required since the MFC feature pack is used.  To compile simply open the IPViewer.sln file to load the project and compile it.

Future versions of this software will most likely evolve to use newer versions of Visual Studio and MFC as they evolve.
